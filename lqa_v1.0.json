Nitrogen-Phosphorus Detector (NPD), also known as Thermionic Ionization Detector (TID): It operates based on the combustion of the sample in a hydrogen-rich flame, where sulfur and phosphorus compounds are burned and subsequently reduced by hydrogen, producing characteristic spectra. It is sensitive specifically to nitrogen and phosphorus hydrocarbons.",

      "answer": "(1) Oilfield water contains high concentrations of H_2S and NH_4, and low concentrations of SO_4 and NO_3.\nHigh concentrations of H_2S and low concentrations of SO_4 in oilfield water are usually due to the reduction of sulfates (SO_4^2-) by bacteria, which occurs under anaerobic conditions. The reduction of sulfate produces sulfide ions (S^2-), which can react with hydrogen ions (H^+) to form H_2S. High concentrations of NH_4 in oilfield water are typically due to the decomposition of organic matter in the reservoir, producing ammonia (NH_3). Then, ammonia reacts with water to form ammonium ions (NH_4^+). The low concentration of NO_3 in oilfield water is usually due to the reduction of nitrates (NO_3^-) by bacteria, which occurs under anaerobic conditions. The reduction of nitrate produces nitrogen gas (N_2), which can escape from the water.\n\n(2) The groundwater from the pumping wells in the water supply area becomes colorless and transparent upon entering the pool, and soon reddish-brown flocculent suspensions appear.\nThis phenomenon is related to the iron ions contained in the groundwater. Iron in groundwater mainly exists in the form of soluble divalent iron (Fe2+), which is relatively stable in the anoxic underground environment. When the pumped groundwater enters the pool and comes into contact with the oxygen (O_2) in the air, divalent iron Fe^2+ is oxidized to trivalent iron (Fe3+), and reacts with water to form iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)_3). Iron hydroxide is insoluble in water and appears as reddish-brown flocculent suspensions.\n\n(3) Calcite appears at the exit of springs in limestone areas.\nLimestone is composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO_3). When water flows over limestone, it dissolves calcium carbonate and reacts with carbon dioxide (CO2) in the water to form soluble calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2). When such spring water flows out and reaches the surface, due to the reduction in pressure and temperature change, the solubility of calcium bicarbonate decreases, causing calcium bicarbonate to decompose into calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide escapes from the water, and calcium carbonate precipitates in the form of calcite. This is why calcite appears at the exit of springs in limestone areas.",

      "answer": "The radioactive heat production rate (A) of a rock refers to the radioactive heat production of radioactive heat-producing elements in the rock per unit time and volume. It is often measured by the product of the content (C) of K, Th, and U in the rock, the heat production rate (H) under the unit mass of the three, and the rock density (ρ).

Concentrations of greenhouse gases have varied substantially during Earth’s history, and these variations have driven substantial climate changes at a wide range of timescales. In general, greenhouse gas concentrations have been particularly high during warm periods and low during cold phases. A number of processes influence greenhouse gas concentrations. Some, such as tectonic activities, operate at timescales of millions of years, whereas others, such as vegetation, soil, wetland, and ocean sources and sinks, operate at timescales of hundreds to thousands of years. Human activities—especially fossil-fuel combustion since the Industrial Revolution—are responsible for steady increases in atmospheric concentrations of various greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).\n 6. Feedback: The feedbacks involve different components that operate at different rates and timescales. Ice sheets, sea ice, terrestrial vegetation, ocean temperatures, weathering rates, ocean circulation, and greenhouse gas concentrations are all influenced either directly or indirectly by the atmosphere; however, they also all feed back into the atmosphere, thereby influencing it in important ways. For example, different forms and densities of vegetation on the land surface influence the albedo, or reflectivity, of Earth’s surface, thus affecting the overall radiation budget at local to regional scales. \n 7. Human activities: Most of this attention has focused on carbon dioxide emission via fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation. Human activities also yield releases of other greenhouse gases, such as methane (from rice cultivation, livestock, landfills, and other sources) and chlorofluorocarbons (from industrial sources). ",
